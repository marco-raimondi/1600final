# Step 3: Creating a File
## This step will explain how to create the file that you will be coding inside of. By this point you should have everything that you need to get started installed.

1. After following the previous steps, you should be on the explorer tab. There, click the button that says "Open Folder".
2. Using the file explorer that opens, navigate to the location on your computer that you want the file to be created, and make a new folder with the name "Hello World".
3. Once the folder has been created, click on the "Terminal" tab, which should be either at the top of your screen or the window, and select "New Terminal".
4. Inside of the terminal, type the command "dotnet new console --use-program-main". This will create a few things inside of your Hello World folder.
5. Click on the Program.cs file that was created after running the command. A small window will pop up on the bottom left of the window asking to create more items, and you should click "Yes".
