# How to write a "Hello World" program in C# by Marco Raimondi
This tutorial will explain the very basics of C# including what to download, how to open a file in C#, and what to write. The target audience of this tutorial is for people with little to no experience with coding and/or C#. Anybody of any age can use the contents of this tutorial to gain the basic knowledge required to write simple C# programs. The "Hello World" program is the generic program that many people create to get themselves started with a coding language as it is very simple to make and understand.

## Requirements:
* Computer with the ability to download Visual Studio Code
* Internet access

## Step 1: Downloading Visual Studio Code
The first thing that you need to do before you can begin coding is download a text editor. For this tutorial you will be using Visual Studio Code since I believe it's an easy to use starting point.

1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Here, you can choose the operating system that you have and download the program.
2. Once you have the installer downloaded, open it and follow the instructions that it will give you. You should just accept all of the default settings too aside from the location, which is personal preference.
3. When you finish using the installer, open the program.

## Step 2: Installing C# and .NET
Before you can begin coding, you need to get the C# extension and .NET, which is the open-source framework that is also required to use Visual Studio Code. You should have Visual Studio Code installed and open for this step.

1. Go to the [.NET Core website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) and choose the installer that fits your operating system.
2. To download the C# extension, click on the tab on the left with 4 squares, which is the extension marketplace. Search for "C#", and find the one with a green icon that was published by Microsoft, and click install.
3. After you have those installed, click on the explorer tab on the left menu, which looks like two pieces of paper.

## Step 3: Open/Create a file
This step will explain how to create the file that you will be coding inside of. By this point you should have everything that you need to get started installed.

1. After following the previous steps, you should be on the explorer tab. There, click the button that says "Open Folder".
2. Using the file explorer that opens, navigate to the location on your computer that you want the file to be created, and make a new folder with the name "Hello World".
3. Once the folder has been created, click on the "Terminal" tab, which should be either at the top of your screen or the window, and select "New Terminal".
4. Inside of the terminal, type the command "dotnet new console --use-program-main". This will create a few things inside of your Hello World folder.
5. Click on the Program.cs file that was created after running the command. A small window will pop up on the bottom left of the window asking to create more items, and you should click "Yes".

## Step 4: Writing the Hello World program
Now we will actually begin writing the program that will say "Hello World".
