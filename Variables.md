# Step 5: Creating Variables

## This step will explain how to create and use variables, along with add them and print them.

1. Delete the "Console.WriteLine" function so that you have an open line.
2. To create a variable, type "var x = 1". This creates the variable with the name 'x' and gives it a value of 1.
3. Create another variable named 'y' and give it another value, for example 2.
4. Now that you have two variables, you can run the program. When you do so, nothing will happen because the variables aren't used. To get anything to print, you need to ask the console to write a line.
5. Make a new Console.WriteLine function. Don't use quotation marks, but inside of the parenthesis write 'x + y'.
6. Now, if you try and run the program it should print the sum of the two variables, in this case 3.
