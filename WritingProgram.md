# Step 4: Writing Your First Program

## Now you are going to write your first C# program, which will print out text.

1. By default, your Program.cs file should already have " Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); ".
2. Type "dotnet run" in the terminal that you previously used to create the files.
3. The terminal should print out exactly what is in the quotation marks: Hello, World!
4. Change what is in the quotations to say something else and see what happens when you run the program again. (ex. Console.WriteLine("This is a Test.");)
5. This should give you a good idea of what the purpose of the WriteLine function is. You can even add more lines to print multiple things.
