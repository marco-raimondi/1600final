## Before you can begin coding, you need to get the C# extension and .NET, which is the open-source framework that is also required to use Visual Studio Code. You should have Visual Studio Code installed and open for this step.

1. Go to the [.NET Core website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) and choose the installer that fits your operating system.
2. To download the C# extension, click on the tab on the left with 4 squares, which is the extension marketplace. Search for "C#", and find the one with a green icon that was published by Microsoft, and click install.
3. After you have those installed, click on the explorer tab on the left menu, which looks like two pieces of paper.
